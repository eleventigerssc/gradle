### Continuous build now works with composite builds

Gradle's [continuous build feature](userguide/continuous_build.html) now works with [composite builds](userguide/composite_builds.html). Gradle will automatically detect changes to any input from any build and rebuild the appropriate pieces.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Changes to handling of project dependencies from project that does not use the Java plugin to a project that does

When a project that does not use the Java plugin has a project dependency on a project that uses the Java plugin, either directly or indirectly via another plugin, then the `runtimeElements` configuration of the target project will be selected. Previous versions of Gradle would select the `default` configuration in this case.

Previous versions of Gradle would select the `runtimeElements` when both projects are using the Java plugin.

This change makes the selection behaviour consistent so that the `runtimeElements` configuration is selected regardless of whether the consuming project uses the Java plugin or not. This is also consistent with the selection when the consuming project is using one of the Android plugins.
